## Overview

A trained neural network that can predict handwritten numbers, all from scratch! ðŸŒ±

The neural network receives 400 pixels vectors, representing greyscale 20 by 20 images containing handwritten numbers. It then uses stochaistic gradient descent, backward propogation, and regularization to train the neural network. I used `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `PIL` dependencies.
